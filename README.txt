My name is Marjorie!

I am interested in wetland restoration. 
I want to help marshes keep pace with sea level rise. 
I'm planning to research how adding a thin layer of sediment to marshes can prevent them from drowning from higher sea levels. 

Monitoring fish and invertebrates is fun. 
Wetland plants are cool.
